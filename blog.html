    <h2>What is EM?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    
    An EM is a unit of typography, equal to the currently specified point-sizev.
This statement doesn’t make sense on the web since we don’t use point-size. It makes complete sense if we substituted
point-size with font-size though.

What it means is: 1em = 20px if a selector has a font-size of 20px.
The em unit can be used to declare font-sizes. In fact, it’s a best practice to use relative units like em for
font-size.</p>

<h2>What is REM?</h2>
<p>
    You might have encountered the term “R.E.M.” before while listening to the radio or your music player. Unlike their
    musical counterparts, named for the “Rapid Eye Movement” during deep sleep, in CSS rem stands for “root em”. They won’t
    make you lose your religion nor believe in a man on the moon. What they can do is help you achieve a harmonious and
    balanced design.rem means Root EM. It’s built to provide some relief the em computational problem that many faced.
    It is a unit of typography equal to the root font-size. This means 1rem is always equal to the font-size defined in

    Font Sizing with Rem Units
    
    older versions of IE still had large market shares and they were unable to zoom text that was sized with
    pixels. However, as we saw earlier, it is very easy to lose track of nesting and get unexpected results with em units.
    
    The main issue with using rem for font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use. Let’s see an example of
    some common font sizes expressed in rem units, assuming, of course, that the base size is 16px:
</p>
<p>all we should know what we mean by rem Units. According to W3C spec the definition for one rem unit is :
Equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When specified on the font-s size property of the
root element,the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.This means that 1 rem equals the font size of
the html element(which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).

<h2>REMs or EMs?</h2>
<p>

<strong>It’s highly debatable.</strong>  

Some developers avoid rem entirely, claiming that using rem makes their components less modular. Others use rem for
everything, preferring the simplicity that rem provides.

Oddly, I fell into the trap of strictly only rem or em at different points in my development career. I loved how em
helped me make modular components, but I loathed the complexity it brought to my code. I also loved how rem made
calculations simple, but I hated the hacks I used to make my components modular.</p>

        <h2>What is EM?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            An EM is a unit of typography, equal to the currently specified point-sizev.
            This statement doesn’t make sense on the web since we don’t use point-size. It makes complete sense if we
            substitutedpoint-size with font-size though. What it means is: 1em = 20px if a selector has a font-size of 20px.
            The em unit can be used to declare font-sizes. In fact, it’s a best practice to use relative units like em for
            font-size.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is REM?</h2>
        <p>
            You might have encountered the term “R.E.M.” before while listening to the radio or your music player. Unlike
            their musical counterparts, named for the “Rapid Eye Movement” during deep sleep, in CSS rem stands for “root em”.
            They won’tmake you lose your religion nor believe in a man on the moon. What they can do is help you achieve a harmonious
            andbalanced design.rem means Root EM. It’s built to provide some relief the em computational problem that many
            faced.It is a unit of typography equal to the root font-size. This means 1rem is always equal to the font-size defined
            in Font Sizing with Rem Unitsolder versions of IE still had large market shares and they were unable to zoom text that was sized with
            pixels. However, as we saw earlier, it is very easy to lose track of nesting and get unexpected results with em
            units. The main issue with using rem for font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use. Let’s see an
            example of some common font sizes expressed in rem units, assuming, of course, that the base size is 16px:
            all we should know what we mean by rem Units. According to W3C spec the definition for one rem unit is :
            Equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When specified on the font-s size property of the
            root element,the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.This means that 1 rem equals the font size of
            the html element(which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).

        <h2>REMs or EMs?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>It’s highly debatable.</strong>
            Some developers avoid rem entirely, claiming that using rem makes their components less modular. Others use rem
            for everything, preferring the simplicity that rem provides.Oddly, I fell into the trap of strictly only rem or em at different points in my development career. I loved how
            em helped me make modular components, but I loathed the complexity it brought to my code. I also loved how rem made
            calculations simple, but I hated the hacks I used to make my components modular.Using dimensions in % or em. Just change the base font size, and everything will change. em is a scalable unit. An em is
            equal to the current font-size, for instance,if the font-size of the document is 12 pt, 1 em is equal to 12 pt. Ems are
            scalable in nature, so 2 em would equal 24 pt,.5 em would equal 6 pt, etc.. Percent (%): The percent unit is much like
            the “em” unit, save for a few fundamental differences.First and foremost, the current font-size is equal to 100% (i.e.
            12 pt = 100%). While using the percent unit, the text remains fully scalable for mobile devices and for accessibility.
            rem stands for root em. It's pretty much the same as em, except it will always be relative to the default font size
            instead of the current element's font size. This can either be the default font size of the browser, usually 16px, or
            one you can set it in your CSS I prefer to use rem for font-sizes, em for margins and paddings and absolute units for
            borders.
            <br>
            I use em for nearly everything, rem occasionally for padding or margins, but only in a pinch, and px some times for
            borders.
            For the most part, I want children to inherit size. If a sidebar is going to be a smaller font size, then I expect all
            its children to resize proportionally without having to calculate and redefine individual selectors.
            I struggle to think of a good reason to use rem for font-size values, but I’m sure there are exceptions. If I’m trying
            to reset a font size with rem, it’s probably a sign my CSS is not very modular and due for a refactor.
        </p>
        <h2>Default browsers width</h2>
        <p>
        The broser interprate this by overriding the default font size of the browser .Setting the font size in pixel values is
        a good choice when you need pixel accuracy. A px value is static. This is an OS-independent and cross-browser way of
        literally telling the browsers to render the letters at exactly the number of pixels in height that is specified. The
        results may vary slightly across browsers, as they may use different algorithms to achieve a similar effect. Font sizing
        settings can also be used in combination. For example, if a parent element is set to 16px and its child element is set
        to 200px, the child element displays larger than the parent element in the page.

    <h3>changes in css3</h3>
    <h2>1. CSS 3 Selectors</h2>
    <p>In addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors
        you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So you don't need to specify classes and IDs for every
        element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style them. if you assign IDs to elements only so you can
        style them, you are probably doing it wrong. CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 introduced a number of powerful selectors that can
        make your layouts cleaner, and your stylesheets more awesome..</p>
    <h2>2. CSS 3 Rounded Corners</h2>
    <p>Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of
        code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in
        content can break them.
        CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing the border-radius property, which gives you the same rounded-corner
        effect and you don't have to write all the code. Here are examples for displaying rounded corners in different
        places of a website.</p>
    <h2>3. CSS 3 Border Image</h2>
    <p>Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The border-image property allows
        you to display custom designed borders around elements. The borders are contained in a single image (sprite), with
        each region of that image corresponding to a different part of the border..</p>
    <h2>4. CSS 3 Box Shadow</h2>
    <p>A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated
        image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS
        code.
        After previously removing this property from the CSS 3 Backgrounds and Borders Module, the W3C added it back in the
        last working draft.</p>
    <h2>5. CSS 3 Text Shadow</h2>
    <p>The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, this would be
        done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it. A similar property called
        box-shadow is also available in CSS 3.</p>
    <h2>6.Media Queries</h2>
    <p>Media queries are an absolute must if you are serious about web design. They have been around for a while, but are
        worth a mention, because they have transformed the way we build websites. It used to be that you had a regular
        website, wide enough to fit the smallest monitor resolution used at the time, and a separate mobile website. These
        days, we build sites that are responsive and which adapt to the type of device, orientation and resolution.
        Media queries are surprisingly easy to use - all you need to do is to enclose CSS styles in a block guarded by a
        code>@media rule. Each code>@media block is activated when one or more conditions are met. As an example, try
        resizing this page. I have also included it in the editor below; try removing the the code>@media block to see what
        happens.</p
